# Explosive-Retrival-Diffusion-and-Disposal Robot
Robots with advanced sensors, image processing, and machine learning detect and neutralize explosives from a safe distance. Visual data and trained models improve detection accuracy, identifying threats efficiently. This integration ensures reliable bomb detection, linking microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators effectively.
# Problem Statement
In Today’s world the people’s safety and security is paramount, due to
development of explosive materials
The increasing use of explosives has caused countless injuries, loss of life,
and lasting psychological trauma, turning ordinary days into tragic "Black
Days”.
There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to prevent such tragedies
and ensure public safety through proactive measures.
Leveraging advanced robotics, we aim to create a reliable solution that
detects, diffuses, and disposes of explosives, fostering a safer and more
secure environment for all
